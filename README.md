## 📘 About the App

Horizen offers a full-year timeline view to help you plan long-term with clarity. Unlike calendar-based apps, Horizen is designed for quick visual planning, time blocking, and rotation management — all in a clean, horizontal format.

## 💡 Common Questions

### Is my data private?
Yes — all your data is stored **locally** on your device. Nothing is synced or shared externally.

### Do you support tap and drag?
Not currently. You tap on a block to edit it. It's simple and intentional — keeping interactions quick and precise.

### Can I create my own categories?
Yes. You can customize both **category names** and **colors** to match your personal or work schedule.

### How does the time analysis feature work?
You can analyze how you've spent your time across different categories, over any date range. It's perfect for reflection, optimization, or reporting.

### How do I report a bug or request a feature?
You have three options:
- Open an issue on this repository
- Email **jhwellsite@outlook.com**
- Use the **“Report a bug”** button inside the app

When reporting a bug, please include:
- what you expected to happen
- what actually happened
- your macOS version
- your app version
- a screenshot if relevant
