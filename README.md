## ðŸ’¡ Common Questions

### Is my data private?
Yes â€” all your data is stored **locally** on your device. Nothing is synced or shared externally.

### Do you support tap and drag?
Not currently. You tap on a block to edit it. It's simple and intentional â€” keeping interactions quick and precise.

### Can I create my own categories?
Yes. You can customize both **category names** and **colors** to match your personal or work schedule.

### How does the time analysis feature work?
You can analyze how you've spent your time across different categories, over any date range. It's perfect for reflection, optimization, or reporting.
